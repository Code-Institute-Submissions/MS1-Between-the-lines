The aim is to create an online space for them to meet other people sharing the same interests.

 # Wireframe

I used Balsamic to build my wireframe prior to the website coding.
The idea was to get an idea of what sections I would build and what design I would roughly create.

# Features 

For all features, I mainly used Bootstrap codes. Here are the details :

Navigation : I use the simple and clear navigation code suggests in Bootstrap. All sections are presented to ease the user
experience and direct to relevant links when clicked.

Modals : To give more details to the user regarding every topics/meetings, I added modals in the Find your community page and the Meetings page.
Every time a user clicks on one topic in each page, a modal will appear to give more details to the customer. A section is included to 
direct the user to the Contact us page if he is interested in joining.

Future features : I would like to add a "Thank you" message after the customer fulfilled the contact page. 
Above all, instead of a contact form to fulfill I would like to permit the user to suscribe to Between the lines 
so as, with his personal log-in, he would become a real member of the community and would be able to subscribe directly to the meetings he is interest in.

Form : I use a simple form template provided by Bootstrap in the Contact us page.

# Project set up
I started coding for a long while, making mistakes in the way I was commiting my files.
Thus, I always forgot to add the documentation through "git add ." before commiting.
When I finally realized my mistake after re-watching the relevant videos on Code institute lessons, I started this new repositary, trying not to make that mistake anymore.
This reason explains in this repository, most of the commits related to index.html, meeting.html and community.html are done with few times intervals.
